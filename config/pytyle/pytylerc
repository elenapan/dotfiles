# Note 2: If you've used XMonad, you'll feel right as rain!

# COMMAND LINE CALLBACKS

# be run on the command line using the pytyle-client executable.
#
# Thanks to Johannes Pirkl for this patch!

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DOCKS, PANELS, ETC...
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This will allow you to forcefully tell PyTyle about any docks/panels that
# you may have. If you have a basic setup (read: one screen), then I would
# advise that you ignore this for now, and only configure this if you notice
# that PyTyle is putting windows over your docks/panels.
#
# However, if you have two or more screens and have docks/panels, you *MUST*
# configure this, otherwise PyTyle will use the entirety of your screens.
# The problem here is that with xinerama, it's only going to tell you the
# x/y/width/height of each screen, and the window manager isn't much more
# help. (Especially since they aren't required to broadcast their struts
# or partial struts, to my knowledge. If I had that information, I might be
# able to eliminate this configuration.)
#
# The configuration is pretty straight-forward. See the commented out example
# for a sample. (Which will create even margins around the tiling windows
# for two screens. It's actually kind of neat looking. Try it.)
#
# Note: If you have this set and you only have one screen, it will override
# the workarea reported by your window manager.
Config.WORKAREA = {}

# Pretty straight forward here. Just use the screen number as your key,
# (starting from zero) and specify *all four* of the configuration
# options: top, bottom, left, and right. Each value should be the number
# of pixels from the edge of the screen that PyTyle should ignore.
#Config.WORKAREA = {
#                   0: {
#                       'top': 100,

# IGNORE WINDOW LIST
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This is a simple list of windows that PyTyle should exclude from
# tiling. It's case-insensitive and will search the name and class
# of the window. (This search algorithm could change, as I haven't
# put much thought into it.)
#
# Note: This is useful for things like run dialogs and other quick
# popups that PyTyle can't detect. (It will, however, detect popups
# within other windows.) Also useful for applications like Gimp.
#
# Note 2: You shouldn't need to put dmenu here.

# TILING PER WORKSPACE/SCREEN
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This will let you configure the default tiling algorithms on a
# per screen per workspace basis. A default tiler must be set.
# Also, see the commented out configuration for an example.
#
# Remember: You can always cycle through the different tiling
# algorithms after the initial tile.
Config.TILING = {
               'default': 'Vertical',
               }

# This configuration sets the default tiler to "Vertical", and the
# default tiler of Screen 1 to "Horizontal" (so all desktops on
# Screen 1 will have a horizontal layout at first). Also, this will
# set the default layout on Screen 0 for desktops 4 and 6 to
# "Horizontal".
#
# Note: Screen and desktop numbers start from 0. So desktop 4 should
# be configured using "3" below.
#
# Take note of the following desktop/viewport numbering scheme:
# One row: 0 1 2 3
# Multiple rows:
# 0 1 2
# 3 4 5
# 6 7 8
#Config.TILING = {
#                 'default': 'Vertical',
#                 0: {
#                       5: 'Horizontal',
#                       7: 'Horizontal',
#                    },
#                 1: 'Horizontal',
#                 }
