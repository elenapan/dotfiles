# Fix Project Diablo 2 launcher bug:
# Play button not visible at the bottom of the screen
# The problem seems to be the existence of my eww bottom bar.
# Solution: In Lutris, add ~/bin/fix-project-diablo-2-launcher as a pre-launch script to
# Project Diablo 2. This closes the bar. Then, we use the following rule to
# re-open the bar and close the launcher after the actual game has started.
for_window [class="^game.exe$" title="^Diablo II$"] exec "eww open bottom-bar; swaymsg '[class=\"^pd2launcher.exe$\"] kill'"
